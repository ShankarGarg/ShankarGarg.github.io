What to look for in this blog
I am starting this blog for sharing my knowledge on Test Automation, primarily in Web, Mobile Automation and Behavior Driven Development using Cucumber. I will be covering end to end topics in Web and Mobile Automation starting from basic info to complex scenarios to creating frameworks from scratch.

I will start with Selenium and Mobile Testing for time being. I will update this page on regular basis for whats i am writing latest.
