	<h1>Hi there, I'm Shankar Garg!</h1>
	<p> I am Agile enthusiast with expertise in Automation Testing. Currently working as Senior Consultant Testing with Xebia IT Architects India.
I started as a Java developer but the love of breaking things got me into Testing. I have worked on automation of many projects for Web, Mobile and SOA Technologies. 
Right now I am in love with Cucumber, Selenium, Appium and Groovy.
<br>
Prior to working with Xebia, I have worked for Jabong.com, Honeywell and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).
I am Certified Scrum Master (CSM), Certified Tester (ISTQB), Certified Programmer for Java (SCJP 5.0) and Oracle 9i (OCA).</p>
